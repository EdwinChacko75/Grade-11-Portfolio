                Hi, welcome to my website! My name is Edwin and I am a grade 11 student at TL Kennedy. 
                2004 was the year I was born and ever since I have been attempting to quench my never-ending 
                thirst for knowledge. I even enrolled in ICS3X0 to that end! This page will help you get to 
                know a little more about me and who I am.

                I like to try new things. I feel that doing so builds character and is the only way you can know 
                if you liked something. Albert Einstein once said; “A person who never made a mistake never tried 
                anything new”. This quote really stuck with me as I am a strong believer in the idea that we learn 
                from our mistakes so if I never try anything new, I am really missing out on the opportunity to learn.

                I like to be active so from a young age, I participated in sports. My favourite sport is basketball and I started 
                playing in grade 6. I loved the game since I started playing but I wasn't any good until high school when I made the 
                basketball team. Last year I started playing rep basketball for 21 Hoops where I got the opportunity to play against 
                some really talented players. I am also an avid swimmer and lifesaver. I began swimming in grade 1- my parents never 
                had the opportunity as children so they wanted to make sure I did. In 2018, I finished all the levels in swimming and 
                attained my Bronze Cross. The following year, I began competing in lifesaving competitions and slowly climbed the ladder 
                till I won my first event, taking home the first-place prize. After grade 9, I became less competitive and now just 
                swim for fun- not since the pandemic of course. Also in grade 9, I discovered weightlifting. Being the active individual 
                I am, I enjoyed weightlifting very much and still do it to this day.

                Being active takes a toll on your body, so after coming home and freshening up, I like to play video games. I started my 
                “gaming career” off with Fortnite when my parents bought us a PlayStation 4 for Christmas 2018. Since then, I have broadened 
                my video game interest to Call of Duty, Minecraft, Battlefront II, and Save The World. Paradoxically, the pandemic has made me 
                play video games less and now I mainly play Call of Duty as I can. I also play chess. I first learned about chess from my dad 
                years ago but now I have gotten into it more than ever. I play on chess.com and my rating has increased from 800 to 1200 in 
                the past few months.
